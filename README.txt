The only file containing this AlexNet model is 'Alexnet_Christian.py'

Ensure that the provided datasets 'X_test.npy', 'X_train.npy', 'y_train.npy' are within the same directory as 'Alexnet_Christian.py'

Run the model by navigating to the directory containing 'Alexnet_Christian.py' within the console and entering 'python Alexnet_Christian.py'

Ensure that the correct modules and packages listed at the top of 'Alexnet_Christian.py' are all installed

If the machine running the model is not powerful, expect epochs to take several minutes each.

Regardless of machine quality, initially loading data will take several minutes.

After running successfully, 'Alexnet_Christian.py' will save a file 'Prediction_Christian.npy' within its directory. This file contains the 'X_test' predictions.

See the comments in 'Alexnet_Christian.py' for details on how the code runs.
